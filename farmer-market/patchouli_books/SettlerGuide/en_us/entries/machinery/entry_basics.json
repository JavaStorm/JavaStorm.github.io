Just craft an empty Fuel Can with a bucket of any of these fuels to fill it up, and right click a machine in the world to fill that up."

Right-click to enter a machine, Left-Shift (sneak) to exit, Control Key to activate the special function of a machine, be it to till land, grade the ground, etc. Open your inventory while riding a machine to access its inventory instead, and insert any tools or materials it uses. For example, add a Plow to a tractor's inventory to till the ground, or a planter and seeds to plant them."
